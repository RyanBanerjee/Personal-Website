          Hey there! I'm Ryan Banerjee, and I'm excited to introduce myself and
          showcase my skills. I'm currently in Year 7 in England and I have a love
          for maths and playing football. I'm also a bit of a Rubik's cube whiz!
          Recently, I've been learning how to code and create websites, and I'm
          really enjoying it. I'm even teaching myself Spanish through duolingo!
        </p>

          With a passion for learning and a desire to take on new challenges, I'm
          constantly pushing myself to be the best I can be. I believe in being
          well-rounded, and that's why I make sure to spend time doing things I
          love, like playing football and solving Rubik's cubes. I'm excited to
          see where my skills and interests will take me in the future!
